## Description

As fellow TV show/movie enthusiasts we wanted to find a better way to search for new movies/shows. The goal was to create a single app that combined results from multiple streaming platforms to give users new releases. We wanted to make a streamlined way of introducing the customer to new content they would enjoy. Our web app accomplishes consolidation of new releases - when you navigate to the site, it instantly searches popular streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime to find you the newest additions to each serviceâ€™s streaming libraries. Through this process, we learned about CSS frameworks, modals, how to integrate bootstrap and web APIs, and gained a deeper understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Usage

Usage of this site is simple - just scroll to view upcoming releases, including movie title, release date, movie poster, and type of content. To use the contact us form, click the 'contact us' button and use the form provided to enter email and messsage.
